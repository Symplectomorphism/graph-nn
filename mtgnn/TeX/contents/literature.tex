The stock market plays a vital role in the economy of nations, serving as the
primary platform for global capital exchange. The course a particular stock
market takes has a substantial impact on the overall state of that nation's
economy. Investors in the stock market strive to maximize their earnings by
analyzing the market information and taking actions in
response~\citep{gao2020application}. Efficient market
hypothesis argues that future stock prices can be predicted using
historical stock data ~\citep{fama1970efficient, shahi2020stock}. However,
predicting stock index prices has long been a difficult task for professionals
in the financial industry and related fields, mainly due to the presence of
non-linearity, volatility, and noise characteristics. Thus, improving the
precision of stock index price prediction and obtaining an accurate prediction
is still a much-debated topic ~\citep{binkowski2018autoregressive}. 

Over the
last decades, several traditional statistical models have been used to predict
stock prices using historical data ~\citep{jarrett2011arima,
tsai2012relationship, mensi2014global, sahoo2015stock, cakra2015stock,
suharsono2017comparison, ma2018investor, izzeldin2019forecasting,
tulcanaza2019determinants,
ning2019stock}. 
In the last 20 years, the rise of computational intelligence has led to the
development of advanced models \textit{(machine learning, deep-learning, and
hybrid models)} for stock market forecasting. Instead of traditional statistical
models that can only consider linear structures like autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregressive (VAR), plenty of new techniques
such as Bayesian networks, fuzzy neural systems, genetic algorithms, recurrent
neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and long-short term
memory (LSTM) have been suggested by numerous researchers
~\citep{cheng2010hybrid, karazmodeh2013stock, chen2015hybrid, chong2017deep,
hiransha2018nse, cao2020multiobjective, nikou2019stock, hargreaves2020stock,
shahi2020stock, setiani2021prediction, pahlawan2021stock, alkhatib2022new,
nasiri2023multi}. 

The last five years has seen the use of graph neural
networks in stock price prediction.~\cite{deng2019knowledge} introduced a knowledge-driven temporal convolutional
network (KDTCN) for stock trend prediction and explanation, emphasizing the
importance of knowledge-driven events in predicting abrupt changes.
~\cite{long2020integrated} integrated deep learning and knowledge graph
techniques to predict stock price trends in the Chinese stock exchange market.
~\cite{sawhney2020spatiotemporal} introduced the spatio-temporal hypergraph
convolution network (STHGCN) for stock movement forecasting, highlighting its
applications in quantitative trading and investment decision-making.
~\cite{sawhney2020deep} proposed a deep attentive learning
architecture for stock movement prediction, leveraging financial data, social
media, and inter-stock relationships through a graph neural network.
~\cite{wu2020connecting} discussed a novel approach to multivariate time series
forecasting using graph neural networks (MTGNN). ~\cite{chen2021novel}
introduced a graph convolutional feature based convolutional neural network
(GC-CNN) model for stock trend prediction, demonstrating superior performance
using Chinese stock data. ~\cite{hou2021st} developed the ST-trader model, a
spatio-temporal deep neural network for modeling stock market movement,
emphasizing the incorporation of inter-connections between firms to forecast
stock prices. Lastly, ~\cite{sawhney2021exploring} explored the scale-free
nature of stock markets and inter-stock correlations, proposing HyperStockGAT as
a model for stock selection based on scale-free graph-based learning. These
studies collectively highlight the effectiveness of graph neural networks in 
predicting stock prices by capturing complex, non-linear relationships to 
enhance accuracy and facilitating decision making in financial markets.

Following~\cite{wu2020connecting}, this study employs the MTGNN framework  to
automatically extract the dependencies in the stock market indices of MINT and
G7 countries from raw time series data. It has been shown that MTGNN is good at 
capturing complex, non-linear relationships between variables by representing
them as nodes in a graph, which paves the way to making accurate predictions
~\cite{wu2020connecting, cui2021metro, he2022multivariate,
liu2022multivariate, jin2022multivariate, chen2022multi, chen2023multi} with 
graph convolution operations.
